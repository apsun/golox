This is my attempt to follow along to the excellent
[Crafting Interpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) book.

It's written in Go because I hope to learn the language better while I'm
at it too. For the most part, it's just a direct translation of the Java
code from the book into Go, with some slight design adjustments to be more
idiomatic.
